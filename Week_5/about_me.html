		<div class= "about_me">
			<p> I am an upcoming senior at Washington High School in Fremont, CA. I am so happy that I participated in Girls Who Code this summer. I have learned so much, made so many friends, and definitely have had an unforgettable experience. Before this program I didn't really know what coding was about, but now I realize how important and useful coding is.
